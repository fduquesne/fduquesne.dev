I recently decided to spend some time on creating a portfolio. I wanted to highlight the skills acquired during various trainings on Front-End technologies. I believe that making a portfolio is one of the best ways to showcase your skills. I then spent several weeks analyzing the value of making one and how to make it attractive.

## Interest

I then did a lot of research on the value of having my own portfolio. It turns out that few developers have one (0.2 - 0.3%). However, taking the initiative is appreciated by employers/clients, having a programming portfolio makes it possible to stand out from other developers.

> If your goal is to get a job, you want to prove to prospective employers that you can do the job. To this end, your work can speak for you. By highlighting different examples of your work, you can demonstrate a depth and breadth of skill that employers will find valuable.

In addition, I did a training on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and I saw here being a good opportunity to concretize the knowledge acquired during this training by creating this portfolio.

## Content

Before launching into the development of my website, I wanted to organize its creation by asking myself a few questions:

- What type of content do I want to highlight? What is the goal?
- Would this be a good opportunity to write articles online?
- Limit website to a single presentation page? Make a portfolio a little more complete?
- What kind of design?

These few questions have been the guiding principle throughout the development of my portfolio.

It's been a while since I wanted to start running an online blog. Creating a portfolio was a good opportunity to start writing some articles on programming and new technologies. So I chose to highlight the different articles written on my portfolio.

I also thought, as we can often see, to put skill bars to display the different technologies with the level of mastery of each. But I quickly realized that the percentages and skill-bars don't mean much. From one person to another, the understanding of these "numbers" is different.

> In reality, having your skills described using percentages or progress bars does not add any value. No one knows what does it actually means. By saying you have "100% skills in Javascript" it would leave the impression that you're the best JS developer in the world. Probably that's not the case. [Percentages and skill-bars tell me nothing](https://dev.to/kethmars/what-i-learned-after-reviewing-over-40-developer-portfolios-9-tips-for-a-better-portfolio-4me7)

For me you can never know everything at 100%. There are always things to learn. As soon as we start to master a language, a library, a framework or other, an update upsets the way in which the technology behaves and requires us to re-learn the new features. It's a never-ending game. That's why, I wanted to present the projects I worked on instead. It is easier to know the level of a developer on a techno by seeing directly how he works.

## Voil√† !

I wanted to give my clients a more concrete and direct view of my work so that they can more easily identify if my skills match their expectations.
It was also, for me, the opportunity to concretize my knowledge on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and to learn other technologies that I did not know such as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).
