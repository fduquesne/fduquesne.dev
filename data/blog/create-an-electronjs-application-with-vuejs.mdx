A tool exists to create applications in VueJS simply: Vue CLI. To be able to install it, you will need to install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
# To verify that the installation was successful
vue --version
```

## VueJS project creation

Vue CLI previously installed allows you to quickly initialize a VueJS project by running the following command:

```bash
vue create electron-vue-application
# "electron-vue-application" is the name of your application.
# You can change it to whatever name you want.
```

The command then asks you to pick a preset. I advise you to select _Manually select features_. Following this, several features can be applied to your new project. I let you choose the features you want for your project.

Once the VueJS project creation process is complete, you can launch your application by running the following commands:

```bash
cd electron-vue-application
npm run serve
```

Your application is then available from the url [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You can then see the default VueJS applications homepage.

## Add ElectronJS to the VueJS application

VueJS has an extension that allows you to easily integrate ElectronJS into the application: `electron-builder`. To install this extension, run the following command:

```bash
vue add electron-builder
```

Electron then asks you which version you want to install. You can choose the version you want but I will advise you to choose the most recent one.

Once completed, it is finally possible to launch our desktop application using ElectronJS / VueJS:

```bash
npm run serve:electron
```

üéâ Tada

> Now that you are going to launch only your VueJS application through ElectronJS, I advise you to modify your `package.json`, remove the `serve` script and replace `serve:electron` with `serve`. This way, you can only run the `npm run serve` command to launch your application in development mode.

## Voil√†

And There you go ! To summarize here is all the commands launched to create an ElectronJS / VueJS application:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create electron-vue-application
cd electron-vue-application
vue add electron-builder
```
